<h1>Pacman👻😀</h1>
<p> Welcome to the Pac-Man Nostalgia Project! This repository is a tribute to the classic arcade game, Pac-Man. I've aimed to recreate the fun and excitement of this iconic game, hoping to bring back some sweet nostalgia for those who loved it and introduce its charm to a new generation. The game is built with plain JavaScript, showcasing the power of vanilla JS in creating interactive web applications. 🕹️</p>
<p>
  <strong>⚠️ Note:</strong> The game is currently not responsive and is best experienced on desktop devices 🖥️.
